# code_samples
Hi! This is a repository for my coding samples. Downloading and knitting `clean_freedomhouse.Rmd` will produce a document that explains how to download FreedomHouse's data directly from their website and clean it using tidyverse and base R functions. The final result is a tidy dataframe.  

The `.md` file is the knitted version for quick viewing.
