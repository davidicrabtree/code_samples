# code_samples
Hi! This is a repository for my coding samples. Downloading and knitting `clean_freedomhouse.Rmd` will produce a document that explains how I downloaded FreedomHouse's data directly from their website and cleaned it using tidyverse and base R functions. The final result is a tidy dataframe.  

The `.md` and `.html` files are the knitted versions for quick viewing.
